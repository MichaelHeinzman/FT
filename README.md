## Extra
I haven't had time to setup full types and checking of data. There are a lot of bugs and a lot of features that I want to add in the future. Definitely would have done this differently now that I've completed the main features. I think I would start over just to see how it would turn out from learning so much by doing this project.  

(Will add more).
